//To verify the Memory Scheduler is able to perform 2 simultaneous reads and one write. Here the cases considered are 2 consecutive reads to same address followed a write to different one at a very later time. After this 2 reads and one write to same address at immediate clock tick. Then 2 different reads (inst fetch and data read) for 2 different addresses followed by a write to a different address
